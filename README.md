# TermTube

This is a script that lets you watch Youtube videos on the command line! It uses the `python-mpv` library to do this. There is also an option in the script that lets you use the already installed `mpv` in your system which has been commented out. It also uses the `youtube-search` library. Take a look at the script to know what you need to have installed before you can run it. 

Clone the directory and run `./termtube.py -h` from the TermTube directory to get instructions on how to use the script.
